NanoFrame [nanoframe.org](https://nanoframe.org) is a web based tool which enables design and synthesis of 3D wireframe objects. This web application takes a single stranded DNA scaffold (either 7249 or 8064-base) with custom sequences and forms the desired wireframe shape in 3D. 
Supported wireframes include cube, sphere, cone, tetrahedron, and many more.

# Control Flow
The application is broken down into three parts, each can be navigated to with the ribbon at the top of the page.
#### Home
NanoFrame allows users to sign up and save their work. Generated work can be saved as both private and public, further, once users login they can discover what other creators have been synthesizing with NanoFrame. 

#### The NanoBot
The NanoBot tab is where all the magic happens. Users can select one of the predefined shapes, or create their own (upcoming feature). After selecting a shape, users can interact with the shape dynamically by adjusting its attributes.

#### API
NanoFrame relies on several API which were developed on par with the project, primarilly motivated by the lack of such API. These are completely free, but to make API calls clients need to register and obtain an API key. 

##### Automatic Staple Generation

##### DNA File Converter
DNA file converter is delivered by [popDNA](https://github.com/tilabberkeley/popDNA). Currently supported file formats are `pdb`, `oxdna`, and `json` (cadnano). The web API is provided for small file formats (< 100Mbs), for larger files please install `popDNA` with one of the [package managers](https://github.com/tilabberkeley/popDNA#installation). For extensive API documentation visit [popDNA.io/api](https://popdna.io/api).

# Staple Generation

# DNA Routing

# Atomic Synthesization
One of the features of NanoFrame is the level fine grain detail. After selecting and editing DNA routing, atomic level visualization is made available either through Mol* which uses the default `pdb` format, or through [oxView](https://sulcgroup.github.io/oxdna-viewer/) which uses the `oxdna` file format. Both of these tool are embedded in the webpage and user can shift through each seemlessly. 

File - by defualt - are generated in `pdb` format. To generate these complex structures, we start off by taking the positions generate through routing. As each nucleotide has a different `pdb` structure we make a map of relative positions of atoms (compared to some base atom) for each of the base bairs. The algorithm, then, starts going through each of the nucleotides in the scaffold adding atoms as neccessary and then applying some twist corresponding to DNA helix structure. 

Once the `pdb` file is generated, the transformation to other formats can be acheived by tools like [tacoxDNA](http://tacoxdna.sissa.it/) or [popDNA](https://github.com/tilabberkeley/popDNA.git) which is tool being developed by the authors of this project. With popDNA, it would be possible to make API calls directly instead of relying on selenium driver for fetching files generated by tacoxDNA. The currently supported formats are `oxDNA` or`json`.
