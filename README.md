Welcome to project NanoFrame. This web application takes a single stranded DNA scaffold 
(either 7249 or 8064-base) with custom sequences and forms the desired wireframe shape in 3D. 
Supported wireframes include cube, sphere, cone, tetrahedron, and many more. 

Generated wireframes are available in many formats including `pdb`, `oxDNA`, `FASFA`, and more. Nanoframe
come in with a built in tool for 3D routing. The tool can be used for the existing design within the Nanoframe
project, or it can be uploaded manually. The list of supported formats is comprehensive.

Nanoframe designs 3D projects through clever use of control and graph theory. The controls used for generating
the design can also be downloaded. More information can be found in **The Project** directory.
