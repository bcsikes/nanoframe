NanoFrame [nanoframe.org](https://nanoframe.org) is a web based tool which enables design and synthesis of 3D wireframe objects. This web application takes a single stranded DNA scaffold (either 7249 or 8064-base) with custom sequences and forms the desired wireframe shape in 3D. 
Supported wireframes include cube, sphere, cone, tetrahedron, and many more.

# Atomic Synthesization
One of the features of NanoFrame is the level fine grain detail. After selecting and editing DNA routing, atomic level visualization is made available either through Mol* which uses the default `pdb` format, or through [oxView](https://sulcgroup.github.io/oxdna-viewer/) which uses the `oxdna` file format. Both of these tool are embedded in the webpage and user can shift through each seemlessly. 

File - by defualt - are generated in `pdb` format. To generate these complex structures, we start off by taking the positions generate through routing. As each nucleotide has a different `pdb` structure we make a map of relative positions of atoms (compared to some base atom) for each of the base bairs. The algorithm, then, starts going through each of the nucleotides in the scaffold adding atoms as neccessary and then applying some twist corresponding to DNA helix structure. 

Once the `pdb` file is generated, the transformation to other formats can be acheived by tools like [tacoxDNA](http://tacoxdna.sissa.it/) or [popDNA](https://github.com/tilabberkeley/popDNA.git) which is tool being developed by the authors of this project. With popDNA, it would be possible to make API calls directly instead of relying on selenium driver for fetching files generated by tacoxDNA. The currently supported formats are `oxDNA` or`json`.
