                    Feed is the entry point of the synthesier tab in the navigation window. In the spirit of open-source and sharing resources, we
                    created a system where users of nanoframe.org can share their creation as well as react to other creations via comments and likes.

                    Searching nanoframes (either through the author or the name of the nanoframe) is possible through the search bar. Additionally, 
                    feed can be sorted by various tag (i.e. date of nanoframe creation). New nanoframes can be generated by clicking the <i>+ New</i> field. See 
                    more details and discussion in the <strong>Synthesizer</strong> section.
