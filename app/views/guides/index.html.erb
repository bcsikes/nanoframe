                Welcome to NanoFrame! This portion of the website is intended to give the reader all the neccessary tools
                to get started synthsyizing with nanoframes. The guides is divided into multiple sections shown on the right sidebar.
                Throughout the development of our software we prioritized the ease of access and chose to model nanoframe.org in the realm
                of software as a service; that way you will never have to worry about installation, saving progress, or viewing what other
                researcher and scientists are up to. Ready to become nanoframe.org poweruser? Start <a href="/guides/home">here</a>.
